        "question": "What are procurement policies",
        "answer": "Procurement policies at the University of Washington are a set of guidelines and procedures designed to ensure that all purchases made on behalf of the University are conducted fairly, transparently, and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The core principles of UW's procurement policy include:\n\n- **Best Value:** Procurement decisions are based on a combination of price, quality, service, and suitability for the intended purpose.\n- **Competition:** The University encourages maximum competition among qualified vendors through its solicitation processes.\n- **Transparency:** All procurement activities are conducted in an open and ethical manner.\n- **Compliance:** All purchases must adhere to UW, state, and federal purchasing laws and regulations.\n\nCommon procurement methods include small purchases (for lower-value items), competitive bids or Requests for Proposals (RFPs) for larger purchases, and sole source procurement, which is only allowed under specific, documented circumstances when only one vendor can provide the required goods or services. All employees involved in purchasing are responsible for understanding and following these policies, as non-compliance may result in audit findings or disciplinary action [UW Procurement Policy Overview.md].\n\nIf you need further clarification or have specific questions about procurement policies or processes, please feel free to contact Richard Pallangyo at rapaugustino@gmail.com."
